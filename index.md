## Environmental Change Beyond CO2
It would be impossible to cover in one morning all the ways in which humans are impacting our environment. In these sessions, we will cover a few topics in more detail. Each presentation will give an introduction to the science and economics of the topic and propose a few directions for research in the area.
### Soils

## Data and Methods for Research in Environmental Economics
These sesions provide an overview of key datasets that are used frequently in environmental economics. Presentations cover:

* What does the data measure?
* How is it collected/constructed/predicted?
* How can you find/download/work with this data?
* Examples of use in research
